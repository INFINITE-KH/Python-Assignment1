Pre words on our solution: 
- We have only been able to complete question 1 and 2, and not in a way that have been expected. We had some major issues with converting the file with the data, although after some time we managede to convert the file but got reallly bad structure of data in the file, which gave us some huge problems to solve the assignment.
So therefore in question 1 we decided that we only look on the crimes for the first year, and last year to analyse if the crime has dropped or grown.
For question 2 we use the result from the first answer, where the graphs shown how the crime has changed.

NOTE: We couldnt fine a way to put to graphs in one model, so we have code for two graps in the bottom of the script which you have to outcomment one at a time to run at see the result.
